- 👋 Hi, I’m @Adamfromky
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML.  I plan to move to CSS and JavaScript afterward for front-end, and then Python for back-end.
- 💞️ In the future when I am adequete, I would like to collaborate on things that interest me, such as weather systems and radar, navigation systems, and possibly VST's for guitar amp sims.  Down the road I would love to mess with A.I.
- 📫 How to reach me:  Send me a message on here or an e-mail.
